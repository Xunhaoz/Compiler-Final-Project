## Introduction 📄

NCU - compiler - final project is a Minilisp compiler implemented using Python. This project aims to provide a compiler for the Minilisp programming language, allowing users to write and execute Minilisp code.

## Features ✨

1. Syntax Validation: The compiler validates the syntax of the Minilisp code to ensure it is correct and error-free.
2. Print: The compiler supports the print statement to display output to the console.
3. Numerical Operations: The compiler provides support for basic numerical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
4. Logical Operations: The compiler supports logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.
5. if Expression: The compiler allows the use of if expressions for conditional execution of code.
6. Variable Definition: Users can define variables and assign values to them using the compiler.
7. Function: The compiler supports the creation and execution of functions.
8. Named Function: Users can define named functions with parameters and execute them.
9. Recursion: The compiler supports recursion, allowing functions to call themselves.
10. Type Checking: The compiler performs type checking to ensure that the correct types of values are used in operations.
11. Nested Function: Users can define nested functions within other functions.
12. First-class Function: The compiler treats functions as first-class citizens, allowing them to be assigned to variables and passed as arguments to other functions.
